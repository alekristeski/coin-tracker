## Description:

The web application is designed by Brainster Academy and primarily built for mobile devices, but it is also responsive on larger screens. The first page of the app is a sign-in form that requires users to input their email and password, which undergoes validation. If users are new to the app, they can access the sign-up page via a link on the sign-in form. Upon successful sign-up, users are directed to a three-step welcome wizard. Here, they can enter their budget, select categories, and set amounts for each category.

Throughout the app, users can utilize the chosen categories, edit or disable them, and add entries to each active category. Additionally, the app features a statistics section that displays visual charts representing the entries.
